I HAVE CREATED README IN GIT REMOTE REPO AND CLONED IN MY LOCAL UBUNTU TERMINAL 

THIS WAS DONE WITH CREATION OF TWO BRANCHES CALLED "FEATURE BRANCH1", "FEATURE BRANCH2"  FROM MAIN BRANCH AND
STEPS:
1) git clone URL
2) git branch -> Master
3) git branch feature1
4) git branch -> Master
                 feature1
5) git checkout feature1
6) vi README and edited some content
7) git add .
8) git commit -m "msg"
9) git push origin feature1
RAISED MERGE REQUEST TO MASTER FROM FEATURE1

4) git branch -> Master
                 feature1
                 feature2
